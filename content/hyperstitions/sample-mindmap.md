This is a thought-in-progress, capturing the emergent structure of a concept. It may change, grow, or be absorbed into other ideas.

## Initial Brainstorm

This mindmap explores the core components of a hyperstition as a concept for this site. It connects the idea of a "meme" to its real-world "manifestation" through the process of "reification."

## Further Thoughts

- How does the feedback loop accelerate?
- What is the role of the "author" or "artist" in this process?
- Can a hyperstition be intentionally designed, or is it purely emergent?
