Interdisciplinary researcher at the intersection of mathematics, philosophy, code, and music.

## Current Focus

Making AI systems transparent and accessible—creating simple showcases where you can take a small model that fits in laptop memory and understand exactly how it works. Everything open-source, everything designed to democratize understanding.

## Research & Building

**Transparent AI Systems** — Creating browser-based tools that reveal how language models actually work. Using WebGL and open-source models to make weights, activations, and latent spaces visible and interactive.

**Human-Centered Interfaces** — Designing software that respects bounded human attention. Progressive disclosure, thoughtful interaction patterns, and tools that support flow rather than interrupt it.

**Mathematical Pattern Recognition** — Applying algebraic geometry and manifold theory to distinguish real mathematical structures from noise in complex systems, from financial time series to neural transformations.

**Musical Composition** — Organ arrangements exploring how textual themes translate into musical architecture, following the path from narrative to harmonic structure.

## Background

- **Algebraic Geometry & Manifold Theory** — Applied to pattern recognition in complex systems, distinguishing rigid mathematical structures from noise
- **NLP for Financial Markets** — Built systems to extract trading signals from Israeli business press, analyzing market player ontologies
- **Time Series Analysis** — Research on prediction methods with focus on making mathematical assumptions explicit for appropriate model selection
- **Dynamical Systems Theory** — Explored topological transformations in tensor spaces and representation theory
- **Philosophy of AI Alignment** — Developed gamified systems for value articulation using academic philosophical frameworks
- **Musical Composition** — Organ arrangements translating narrative motifs into musical structures, recently performed arrangements of poetry
