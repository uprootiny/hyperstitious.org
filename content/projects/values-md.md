A lightweight, structured format for defining ethical frameworks in AI and decision-making systems, bridging philosophical ethics with technical implementation.

## Overview

VALUES.MD provides a standardized way to encode ethical reasoning into machine-readable formats. Rather than leaving ethical considerations as afterthoughts or informal guidelines, this format makes them explicit, testable, and integrable into AI systems.

## Core Components

**Parser & Validator** — Converts VALUES.MD files to JSON and ensures specification compliance

**Evaluator** — Applies ethical frameworks to real decisions and outputs reasoning traces

**Generator** — Creates VALUES.MD files from structured inputs and templates

**Visualization** — React-based components for displaying ethical frameworks interactively

## Technical Architecture

The format uses a hierarchical structure:

1. **Core Values** — Fundamental principles, weighted by priority
2. **Guiding Principles** — Actionable guidelines derived from core values  
3. **Decision Heuristics** — Practical rules for common scenarios
4. **Domain Frameworks** — Specialized ethical considerations for specific contexts
5. **Ethical Algorithms** — Computational procedures for ethical evaluation
6. **Response Templates** — Structured outputs for ethical reasoning

## Why This Matters

**Transparency** — Makes implicit ethical assumptions explicit and auditable

**Consistency** — Ensures ethical reasoning is systematic rather than ad-hoc

**Integration** — Bridges the gap between philosophical ethics and technical systems

**Documentation** — Creates a permanent record of ethical considerations and their evolution

## Implementation Details

- **Lightweight**: 2-10KB memory footprint
- **Language Agnostic**: JSON output works with any system
- **Extensible**: Custom domains and evaluation criteria
- **Validated**: Schema-based validation ensures correctness

## Use Cases

1. **AI System Ethics** — Encoding ethical guardrails into language models and decision systems
2. **Organizational Ethics** — Documenting company values in machine-readable format
3. **Research Ethics** — Formalizing ethical frameworks for academic and industrial research
4. **Audit Trails** — Creating verifiable records of ethical decision-making processes

The goal is simple: make ethics as rigorous and systematic as any other aspect of system design.
