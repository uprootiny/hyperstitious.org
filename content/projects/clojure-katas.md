A collection of programming katas (practice exercises) designed to explore the mathematical foundations and functional paradigms that make Clojure uniquely expressive.

## Philosophy

Clojure embodies computation as mathematical transformation—immutable data structures flowing through pure functions, with persistent data structures that maintain performance while preserving referential transparency. These katas explore that mathematical beauty through practical exercises.

## Structure

**Core Exercises** — Fundamental operations on sequences, maps, and sets using Clojure's rich standard library

**Mathematical Patterns** — Exercises that reveal the algebraic structures underlying functional programming

**Transformation Pipelines** — Complex data transformations using threading macros and transducers

**Concurrency Patterns** — Exploring Clojure's approach to managing state and time through atoms, refs, and agents

## Technical Setup

- **deps.edn** — Modern Clojure dependency management
- **shadow-cljs.edn** — ClojureScript compilation for browser-based exercises
- **REPL-Driven Development** — Interactive exploration and immediate feedback

## Why Clojure

Clojure treats code as data (homoiconicity), making it possible to reason about programs using the same tools used to reason about data structures. This creates a uniquely powerful environment for exploring computational patterns.

**Immutability** — All data structures are immutable by default, eliminating entire classes of bugs

**Functional Composition** — Functions compose naturally, creating complex behavior from simple building blocks

**Lisp Syntax** — Minimal syntax that gets out of the way of mathematical expression

**JVM Integration** — Access to the entire Java ecosystem while maintaining functional purity

## Sample Kata Domains

1. **Sequence Transformations** — Working with lazy sequences and infinite data structures
2. **Tree Traversals** — Exploring recursive structures and pattern matching
3. **State Machines** — Modeling complex state transitions functionally
4. **Data Validation** — Building composable validation systems using predicates
5. **Parser Combinators** — Constructing parsers from small, reusable components

## Mathematical Foundations

Each kata is designed to illuminate fundamental concepts:
- **Monoids and Semigroups** — Understanding combinable operations
- **Functors and Applicatives** — Mapping functions over containers
- **Lazy Evaluation** — Working with potentially infinite data structures
- **Persistent Data Structures** — Efficient immutability through structural sharing

The goal is to internalize functional thinking patterns that make complex problems simple through proper abstraction and composition.
