An interactive WebGL experiment that pushes the boundaries of browser-based 3D graphics and multi-touch interaction.

## Overview

This project explores real-time mesh generation and dynamic surface painting in the browser. Using WebGL's capabilities, it creates a responsive canvas where surfaces can be manipulated through multi-touch gestures while simultaneously generating procedural textures and patterns.

## Technical Implementation

- **WebGL Mesh Generation**  Real-time creation and manipulation of 3D meshes directly in the browser
- **Multi-touch Gesture Support**  Intuitive interaction through pinch, rotate, and swipe gestures
- **Dynamic Surface Generation**  Surfaces are generated and textured on-the-fly based on user interaction
- **Procedural Pattern Generation**  Implements reaction-diffusion systems inspired by Turing's 1952 morphogenesis paper

## Research Context

The pattern generation system draws from Alan Turing's seminal work on morphogenesis, particularly his mathematical models for leopard spots and other biological patterns. This creates a unique intersection between computational biology, interactive graphics, and mathematical visualization.

## Applications

Beyond its immediate visual appeal, this framework serves as a rapid prototyping environment for:
- Interactive mathematical visualizations
- Browser-based scientific presentations
- Exploration of reaction-diffusion systems
- Multi-touch interface experiments
