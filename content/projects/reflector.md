A personal domain monitoring dashboard that combines practical infrastructure monitoring with experimental approaches to data visualization and multi-language system integration.

## Overview

Reflector serves as both a functional monitoring tool and a laboratory for exploring how different programming paradigms can work together in a single system. Currently deployed at [dashboard.dissemblage.art](https://dashboard.dissemblage.art/reflector-index.html).

## Technical Architecture

**Multi-Language Composition** — Demonstrates how different languages excel at different aspects of system monitoring:

- **HTML/TypeScript** (90%+) — Interactive dashboard and real-time visualizations
- **Clojure** — Functional data transformations and configuration management  
- **Python** — Monitoring scripts and data collection automation
- **JavaScript** — Client-side reactivity and dynamic updates

## Monitoring Capabilities

**Domain Health Tracking** — SSL certificate expiration, DNS resolution, response times

**Infrastructure Observability** — Server health, uptime monitoring, and alert generation

**Performance Analytics** — Historical trending and anomaly detection

**Visual Dashboards** — Real-time charts and status indicators

## Experimental Features

This project serves as a testbed for several experimental approaches:

1. **Polyglot Architecture** — Exploring how functional programming (Clojure) can complement imperative monitoring scripts
2. **Reactive Dashboards** — Building responsive interfaces that update in real-time without page refreshes
3. **Configuration as Code** — Managing infrastructure monitoring through declarative specifications
4. **Data Pipeline Composition** — Combining different data processing paradigms in a single system

## Why Multi-Language

Rather than forcing everything into a single language, Reflector demonstrates how to:
- Use each language where it's strongest
- Maintain clean interfaces between components
- Keep the system comprehensible despite technological diversity
- Enable rapid experimentation with new approaches

## Technical Innovation

The dashboard explores modern web technologies while maintaining simplicity:
- **No Build System Complexity** — Direct browser loading where possible
- **Progressive Enhancement** — Core functionality works without JavaScript
- **Minimal Dependencies** — Avoiding framework lock-in
- **Composable Components** — Each monitoring capability is independently useful
