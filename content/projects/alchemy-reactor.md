An experimental interface for synthesizing philosophical concepts across different traditions into coherent essays.

## Overview

Alchemy Reactor transforms key concepts from diverse philosophical traditions into interactive tokens that float in a shared conceptual space. By connecting these tokens, users can generate essays that explore the relationships between ideas from different schools of thought.

## How It Works

1. **Concept Extraction** — Key ideas from various philosophical ontologies are distilled into manipulable tokens
2. **Visual Interaction** — Tokens float in an aquarium-like environment where they can be selected and connected
3. **Synthesis Engine** — Connected concept clusters are processed through carefully designed prompts
4. **Essay Generation** — An LLM generates coherent essays based on the conceptual connections

## Philosophical Grounding

To ensure intellectual rigor rather than mere word association, the system includes:
- A curated catalog of voices from different analytical traditions
- Specialized templates for different types of philosophical discourse
- Careful prompt engineering to maintain conceptual coherence

## Design Philosophy

This tool embodies the belief that philosophical traditions, while distinct, can engage in productive dialogue. By making abstract concepts tangible and combinable, it encourages exploration of unexpected intellectual connections while maintaining philosophical integrity.

## Applications

- **Educational Tool** — Explore relationships between philosophical concepts
- **Creative Writing** — Generate philosophical essays from novel concept combinations
- **Research Aid** — Discover unexpected connections between disparate traditions
- **Value Alignment** — Part of a larger system for articulating personal philosophical frameworks
